Additionally, this phone boasts an innovative OIS that works to reduce camera shake and provide steady, blur-free images, even in dim lighting conditions. An additional benefit of this phone is its 120 Hz Pro AMOLED display with adaptive sync, which provides a fluid, lively, and engaging user experience. You can enjoy this phone's MediaTek Dimesity 1080 processor efficiently since it has a big vapour chamber, a high CPU frequency, and compatibility with 10 5G bands."
